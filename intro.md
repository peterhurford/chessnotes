## Opening

* Develop pieces to control the center.
* Develop = move pieces.
* Try not to move the same piece twice.
* Try to castle as soon as possible. Before move 7-10.
* Goal of opening to connect rooks.

## Midgame

* File - column
* Double attack - threatening to take two pieces at once - often you get one of the two because only one of the two pieces can be moved to safety.
* Fork - a double attack with a knight or pawn.
* Absolute pin - a piece cannot move because it would open check.
* Relative pin - a piece ought not move strategically because it would open a profitable attack on a more valuable piece.
* Skewer - Forcing a piece to move and open a profitable attack (reverse pin)
* Discovery - Making a move that opens up an attack from another piece.
* Smothered checkmate - King is checkmated because the King can't move due to his own pieces.
* Supportmate - King is checkmated by a piece the King would be able to take if only it weren't supported by another piece.
* Back rank checkmate - King is checkmated on the back row.
* Doubled pawns - Two pawns in the same file.
* Isolated pawns - Pawn with no other pawn in an adjacent file. (Can't be supported.)
* Backwards pawns - Pawn behind other pawns that cannot be safely advanced.
